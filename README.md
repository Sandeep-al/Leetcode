# LeetCode Solutions 🚀

This repository contains my personal solutions to algorithmic problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), implemented primarily in **C++**.

The goal is to master Data Structures & Algorithms by focusing on optimized **Time & Space Complexity** and identifying core problem-solving patterns.

## 📂 Directory Structure

Solutions are organized by topic to make revision easier:

```text
├── Backtracking/         # N-Queens, Partitioning, Grid Traversal
├── Dynamic-Programming/  # 1D DP, 2D Grids, Knapsack
├── Trees/                # BST, Traversals, Views
├── Graphs/               # BFS, DFS, Shortest Paths
├── Arrays-Strings/       # Sliding Window, Two Pointers
